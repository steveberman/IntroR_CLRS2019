</ol>

## Schedule
```{r eval=require('DT'), tidy=FALSE, echo=FALSE}

## What is <code class="remark-inline-code">R</code>
<div class="rlogo"> <img src="rlogo.png" width="100px"> </div>

<ol>
  <li> <code class="remark-inline-code">R</code> is a free software environment for statistical computing and graphics.</li>
  <li> <code class="remark-inline-code">R</code> != R Studio  </li>
</ol>

<div class="rlogo"> <img src="RStudio-Logo-Blue-Gray-125.png"> </div>
<ol>
  <li> RStudio is an integrated development environment (IDE) for <code class="remark-inline-code">R</code>. It includes a console, syntax-highlighting editor that supports direct code execution, as well as tools for plotting, history, debugging and workspace management.</li>
</ol>

## What is <code class="remark-inline-code">R</code>

> <code class="remark-inline-code">R</code> has had a revolutionary effect on the way statistics are communicated.  
> --- John Chambers

<font style="font-size:16pt">
<ol>
  <li> <code class="remark-inline-code">R</code> provides a wide variety of statistical (linear and nonlinear modelling, classical statistical tests, time-series analysis, classification, clustering, ...) and graphical techniques, and is highly extensible. </li>
  <li> One of <code class="remark-inline-code">R</code>'s strengths is the ease with which well-designed publication-quality plots can be produced, including mathematical symbols and formulae where needed. Great care has been taken over the defaults for the minor design choices in graphics, but the user retains full control.</li>
  <li> <code class="remark-inline-code">R</code> is available as Free Software under the terms of the Free Software Foundation's GNU General Public License in source code form.</li>
</ol>
</font>

## What is <code class="remark-inline-code">R</code>?
<font style="font-size:16pt">
R is an integrated suite of software facilities for **data manipulation, calculation and graphical display.** It includes an effective **data handling** and storage facility, a suite of operators for **calculations on arrays, in particular matrices**, a large, coherent, integrated collection of intermediate tools for **data analysis, graphical facilities for data analysis and display either on-screen or on hardcopy, and a well-developed, simple and effective programming language** which includes conditionals, loops, user-defined recursive functions and input and output facilities.

The term "environment" is intended to characterize it as a fully planned and coherent system, rather than an incremental accretion of very specific and inflexible tools, as is frequently the case with other data analysis software.
</font>

## What is <code class="remark-inline-code">R</code>?
<font style="font-size:16pt">
<code class="remark-inline-code">R</code>, like <code class="remark-inline-code">S</code>, is designed around a true computer language, and it allows users to add additional functionality by defining new functions. 

Many users think of <code class="remark-inline-code">R</code> as a statistics system. We prefer to think of it of an environment within which statistical techniques are implemented. <code class="remark-inline-code">R</code> can be extended (easily) via packages. There are about eight packages supplied with the <code class="remark-inline-code">R</code> distribution and many more are available through the CRAN family of Internet sites covering a very wide range of modern statistics.

# Getting Started in R

##  Options

### Available in Tools/Global Options

* General: Save of history, or .Rdata (probably best if you don't)
* General: Default version of R
* Appearance: Choose editor themes - can create custom
* Code / Diagnostics
* Pane Layout: Change panel positions
* Code / Completion: snippets, autocompletion
    
## Script

* Create a script
* Save it, close it, open it

## Keyboard shortcuts

https://support.rstudio.com/hc/en-us/articles/200711853-Keyboard-Shortcuts

Keyboard Shortcut | Function
------------------| -----------------------------------------
ALT+SHIFT+K       | Show quick reference
ALT+-             | Insert assignment operator (`<-`)
CTRL+ENTER        | Execute selected code
CTRL+1            | Go to Source Editor
CTRL+2            | Go to Console
CTRL+SHIFT+M      | Insert pipe operator (`%>%`)
CTRL+L            | Clear console
CTRL+SHIFT+N      | Create new file
CTRL+W            | Close active document
CTRL+SHIFT+F      | Find in files
CTRL+SHIFT+B      | Build / rebuild package

## Code execution

CTRL+ENTER

90% of your code writing and execution will be done in scripts. Use the console for getting help or one-off operations like: package installation, light debugging.

## Speaking of debugging

R has a debugging framework....



## The working directory

```{r}
getwd()
```

You will probably never have a good reason to call `setwd()`. Use a project instead.

## Projects (*.Rproj)

* Collect all of the files relevant to a project
* Automatically set the working directory 
* Intermediate stuff:
  * Version control (with Git)
  * Package development

## Packages

There are thousands!

```{r eval=FALSE}
install.packages('actuar')
library(actuar)
```

Can install through Tools / Install packages as well.

## Data in packages

```{r eval=FALSE}
data(package = 'Lahman')   # load or list available datasets
data(iris)
```

datasets packages contains some sample data

## Installation vs. library

* install.packages()` copies files to your computer.
* `library()` finds those files and loads them into memory, where they remain until the session ends

## Package installation folder

```{r}
.libPaths()
```

Create a "universal" library by creating a file called ".Renviron".

```
R_LIBS="~/Rlibs"
```

## Exercise

Create an RStudio project to contain your work for this training.
